Hello there! This is the code base for my e-book "Programmatic Roster Scheduling".
You can directly run the code in main.py. It contains the full set-up: staff, dates, constraints, objectives, and excel.

## To get started:
1. run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
2. run "python main.py"

You will get the result in the output.xlsx file.
